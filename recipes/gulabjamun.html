    <p>
        Gulab jamun is a popular Indian sweet delicacy that is loved for its rich and indulgent flavors. It is made by combining khoya (reduced milk solids) or milk powder with a small amount of all-purpose flour, forming a dough that is shaped into small balls. These balls are deep-fried until golden brown, giving them a slightly crispy texture on the outside.

        Once fried, the gulab jamun balls are soaked in a sweet syrup flavored with rosewater, saffron, and cardamom. This syrup adds a delightful sweetness and aromatic essence to the dessert. The gulab jamuns absorb the syrup, becoming soft, spongy, and incredibly moist.

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup Maida</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Mawa</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
            <li>Ghee/oil</li>
            <li>3-4 Green cardamoms</li>
            <li>8-10 saffron stands</li>
            <li>1.5 cups sugar</li>
            <li>2.5 cups water</li>

    <div class="steps">
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take 1½ cups sugar, 3-4 green cardamoms (or 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder) and 8-10 saffron strands in a deep pan.</li>
            <li>Add 2½ cups water and bring mixture to boil over high flame. When it comes to rolling boil, reduce flame to medium and cook until sugar syrup is little sticky, it will take around 10-12 minutes. Stir occasionally in between. Turn off the flame. Sugar syrup is ready. After deep frying jamuns in later step, heat the sugar syrup for 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare 1 cup mawa by following the recipe given above or use readymade mawa. Crumble it using hand or grate it using a grater. Add 1/8 teaspoon baking soda and 1/2 cup sifted maida.</li>
            <li>Knead all of them together until smooth dough is prepared. If required add a few teaspoons of milk to knead a smooth and soft dough</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 16-18 equal parts, grease hands with ghee and make smooth surfaced balls from it. Make sure that there is no crack on the surface of balls because it will make jamuns to crack open while deep frying</li>
            <li>Heat ghee or oil (or 1/2 ghee and 1/2 oil) in a pan over medium flame. When ghee is medium hot, add a pinch of dough in hot ghee and if it comes upward immediately without changing it’s color, ghee is ready. If it turns brown immediately, ghee is too hot. If it doesn’t come upward, ghee is cold. Add prepared dough balls (4-6 at a time or depending on the size of a pan) and deep-fry them over low to medium flame.</li>
            <li>After 3-4 minutes, they will turn light golden brown.</li>
            <li>Deep fry them until they turn golden brown, it will take around 6-7 minutes. Cooking them evenly is the key to soft and textured gulab jamuns, increase or decrease flame intensity to keep the temperature of ghee even while frying them.</li>
            <li>Drain and transfer them over kitchen napkin and let them cool for 5-minutes. As you can see, the balls are increased in size after deep frying</li>
            <li>step-12
                Add fried balls into warm sugar syrup (not hot syrup). If you add them into hot syrup, they will shrink in size.</li>
            <li>Soak them for at least 1-2 hours before serving. As you can see in the picture, the jammuns are increased to almost double in size. Gulab jamuns are ready for serving. Serve them warm or chilled.</li>
