    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        Gulab jamun is a popular Indian sweet delicacy that is loved for its rich and indulgent flavors. It is made by combining khoya (reduced milk solids) or milk powder with a small amount of all-purpose flour, forming a dough that is shaped into small balls. These balls are deep-fried until golden brown, giving them a slightly crispy texture on the outside.

        Once fried, the gulab jamun balls are soaked in a sweet syrup flavored with rosewater, saffron, and cardamom. This syrup adds a delightful sweetness and aromatic essence to the dessert. The gulab jamuns absorb the syrup, becoming soft, spongy, and incredibly moist.
