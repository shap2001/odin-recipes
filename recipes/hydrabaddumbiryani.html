    <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3.5 cups water</li>
            <li>2.25 cups long-grain basmati rice</li>
            <li>4 bat leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup warm milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch saffron strands</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ghee</li>
            <li>2 onions thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 green chillies chopped</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grind black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, star anise and cumin seeds into a fine powder. Finely chop mint and coriander leaves. </li>
            <li>Add dry spice mix, chopped mint and coriander leaves and other marinade ingredients in a mixing bowl and combine all of them. Add the chicken and coat it well. Use a plastic wrap to cover the bowl and let the marinated chicken sit in the refrigerator for about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Wash the rice thoroughly. Take a saucepan and add water and rice in it. Once it boils, add 2 bay leaves and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and let it simmer until rice is partially cooked and is firm. This might take about 5 minutes. Once done, drain the rice. Add saffron to a bowl of milk, stir and keep it aside.</li>
            <li>Add ghee to a large pot with a tight-fitting lid or a pressure cooker, heat it over medium-high flame. Stir in onions until golden brown for about 15 minutes. Drain them on a paper towel. Switch the flame to low and add bay leaves, chillies, and stir for about 1-2 minutes. Remove a tbsp of ghee from the pot and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken along with the marinade into the pot and cook for 2 minutes per side until itâ€™s no longer pink. Spread the drained rice on top, sprinkle fried onions and drizzle ghee with saffron milk on top. Cook for 8-10 minutes over a high flame covered with a lid. Then reduce the flame to low and continue cooking for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the flame and let it stand covered for about 15 minutes. Garnish with mint and coriander leaves on top. Serve hot with raita or green salad.</li>
